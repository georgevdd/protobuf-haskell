This project documents Chris Kuklewicz' Haskell implementation of [Google Protocol Buffers](http://p/protobuf). It assumes that the reader is already familiar with Haskell and has access to an appropriate Haskell environment (including the `cabal` tool).

# Getting Started #

The code is on Hackage at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hprotoc. It can be installed with:
```
cabal install hprotoc
```
The [Basics](Basics.md) page describes how to use the package.
